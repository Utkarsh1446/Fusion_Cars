AI Model: Website Redesign Based on Existing Site
Core Analysis Framework

Conduct Comprehensive Site Audit

Analyze the existing website's structure, navigation, and information architecture
Identify the current design style, color palette, typography, and visual hierarchy
Document all existing pages, sections, and content types
Note technical aspects: responsiveness, loading speed, accessibility features
List all interactive elements, CTAs, and user flows


Define Strategic Foundation

Identify the website's purpose: What problem does it solve? What is the primary goal?
Define target audience: Who are the users? What are their needs, pain points, and behaviors?
Establish core values: What principles should the design communicate?
Clarify desired perception: How should users feel when interacting with the site?
Document competitive landscape: What makes this site different from competitors?


Evaluate Current Performance

Assess what's working well (preserve these elements)
Identify pain points and friction areas (prioritize for improvement)
Review analytics data if available: bounce rates, conversion rates, user journeys
Note accessibility issues and technical debt
Document user feedback and common complaints



Design Strategy Rules

Establish Visual Direction

Create 2-3 distinct visual directions that align with brand strategy
For each direction, define: mood, style references, color approach, typography system
Ensure directions balance innovation with familiarity (don't alienate existing users)
Present rationale for each direction tied to business goals
Select final direction based on strategic alignment, not just aesthetics


Information Architecture Principles

Organize content by user needs, not internal company structure
Limit primary navigation to 5-7 items maximum
Create clear content hierarchy: primary, secondary, tertiary levels
Ensure every page answers: "Where am I? What can I do here? Where can I go next?"
Design for scannability: use clear headings, short paragraphs, bullet points


Visual Hierarchy Rules

Establish typographic scale: heading levels (H1-H6) with consistent sizing
Create spacing system: use multiples of 8px for margins and padding
Define color usage: primary (brand), secondary (accents), neutral (backgrounds/text)
Use whitespace generously to reduce cognitive load
Guide eye movement intentionally using size, color, position, and contrast



Content & Messaging Guidelines

Content Strategy

Write headlines that communicate value, not just describe features
Use active voice and action-oriented language
Keep sentences concise (15-20 words maximum)
Lead with benefits before explaining features
Include social proof: testimonials, case studies, metrics, logos


Calls-to-Action (CTA) Rules

Make primary CTA visually dominant on each page
Use specific action verbs ("Start Free Trial" not "Submit")
Limit to 1-2 CTAs per viewport to avoid decision paralysis
Create visual contrast: CTAs should stand out from surrounding elements
Position strategically: above fold, after value propositions, at content end



Technical Implementation Standards

Responsive Design Requirements

Design mobile-first, then scale up to tablet and desktop
Ensure touch targets are minimum 44x44px on mobile
Test readability: minimum 16px font size for body text
Optimize images: use modern formats (WebP), implement lazy loading
Ensure functional parity across devices (no missing features on mobile)


Performance Optimization

Minimize HTTP requests: combine files, use CSS sprites where appropriate
Implement critical CSS for above-the-fold content
Defer non-critical JavaScript loading
Compress and optimize all images before upload
Target page load time under 3 seconds on 3G connection


Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)

Ensure color contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
Provide alt text for all images (descriptive, not generic)
Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
Use semantic HTML: proper heading hierarchy, landmarks, labels
Test with screen readers and validate with accessibility tools



Page-Specific Guidelines

Homepage Design

Hero section must answer: What do you do? Who is it for? Why should I care?
Include value proposition within first 3 seconds of viewing
Show, don't just tell: use visuals, demos, or examples
Address 3-5 key user concerns or use cases
End with strong CTA and trust indicators (testimonials, logos, metrics)


Navigation Design

Make logo/brand clickable to homepage from any page
Ensure navigation is sticky or easily accessible when scrolling
Use mega-menus for sites with 20+ pages
Include search functionality for content-heavy sites
Add breadcrumbs for sites with deep hierarchies


Product/Service Pages

Lead with outcome/benefit, not features list
Use comparison tables for multiple offerings
Include pricing (or "Contact for pricing" if enterprise)
Add FAQ section to address common objections
Show before/after examples or use case scenarios


Contact/Conversion Pages

Minimize form fields (ask only what's essential)
Provide multiple contact options (form, email, phone, chat)
Set clear expectations: response time, next steps
Remove navigation distractions on conversion pages
Add reassurance: privacy policy, no spam promises, security badges
