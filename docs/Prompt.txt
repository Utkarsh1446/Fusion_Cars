Prompt:

You are a senior front-end developer and UI/UX designer. Redesign the website https://fusioncars.in/
 to make it modern, modular, responsive, and accessible, following best UI/UX design principles.

Goals:

Keep the structure aligned with the original website’s content and purpose (car dealership/showcase platform).

Make it visually appealing, clean, and professional with an emphasis on trust, luxury, and modernity.

Improve user accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and page load speed.

Create a modular and scalable architecture suitable for future expansion (new pages, features, or dynamic content).

Design Requirements:

Use React (Next.js preferred) or Vite + React with Tailwind CSS for styling.

Design a modular component-based layout with reusable UI blocks (Navbar, Hero, CarCards, Testimonials, Footer, etc.).

Implement WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards:

Proper color contrast

Keyboard navigation

ARIA labels

Semantic HTML

Add smooth micro-interactions and animations (Framer Motion or similar).

Make the design fully responsive (mobile-first, adaptive to tablet and desktop).

Optimize for SEO and performance (semantic tags, image optimization, lazy loading).

Color Palette & Theme Suggestions:

Primary: Deep navy (#0B132B) or Charcoal gray (#1C1C1E)

Accent: Electric blue (#007BFF) or Neon orange (#FF6700)

Neutral: Light gray (#F5F5F5), White (#FFFFFF)

Typography: Modern sans-serif (e.g., Poppins, Inter, or Manrope)

Contrast focus: Minimalist with clean whitespaces and readable text.

Page Structure:

Home Page: Hero section, Car categories, Featured listings, Testimonials, CTA (Book a Test Drive), and Footer.

About Page: Company story, mission, values, and contact CTA.

Inventory Page: Filterable car listings (by brand, model, price, fuel type).

Contact Page: Contact form, map, and social links.

UI/UX Inspirations:

Tesla.com (clean, premium feel)

BMW.in (structured layout)

Carwow.co.uk (modern listing interface)

Deliverables:

Clean, production-ready frontend code (React + Tailwind or Next.js).

Modular component structure with separate folders (/components, /pages, /assets).

All text and images replaced with placeholder data, but structure aligned with the live site’s purpose.

Add dummy JSON data for car listings to show filtering/sorting logic.

Include responsive navigation with dropdown and hamburger menu for mobile.

Final Task:
Generate all necessary code files (JSX, CSS, JSON) with comments explaining each major section. Ensure clean, readable structure, consistent naming, and scalability for future integration with a backend or CMS.
